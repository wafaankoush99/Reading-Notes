# Review, Research, and Discussion


1. Does a deployed React application require a server?.

You don't necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. It also works well when integrated into an existing server side app.


2. Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?

Unit testing is a great discipline which can lead to 40%-80% reductions in bug density. Unit testing also has several other important benefits: Improves your application architecture and maintainability.


3. What does npm run build do?

- npm run build runs the script "build" and created a script which runs your application - let's say server.js.
- npm start runs the "start" script which will then be "node server.js"


4. Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application

Unlike other UI libraries and frameworks, Reactjs doesn't enforce an architecture pattern. It is just a view that caters to the user interface. Just beneath the user interface lies a tree of several React components.

## Term

- BDD

Behavior-driven development is an extension of test-driven development, a development process that makes use of a simple, DSL. These DSLs convert structured natural language statements into executable tests.

The Behavior-Driven Development Process

The BDD process moves through three phases—discovery, formulation, and automation—where the acceptance criteria are transformed into acceptance tests that are later automated.

BDD is a software development process for teams to create simple scenarios on how an application should behave from the end user's perspective. The goal of implementing BDD testing is to improve collaboration between stakeholders, such as developers, testers, product managers, and business analysts.



- Acceptance Tests


Acceptance testing in extreme programming
Acceptance testing is a term used in agile software development methodologies, particularly extreme programming, referring to the functional testing of a user story by the software development team during the implementation phase. ... Acceptance tests are black-box system tests.


- mounting

Mounting is a process by which the operating system makes files and directories on a storage device (such as hard drive, CD-ROM, or network share) available for users to access via the computer's file system.



- build

In a programming context, a build is a version of a program. As a rule, a build is a pre-release version and as such is identified by a build number, rather than by a release number. ... As a verb, to build can mean either to write code or to put individual coded components of a program together.

## Understanding React `setState`

React components can, and often do, have state. State can be anything, but think of things like whether a user is logged in or not and displaying the correct username based on which account is active. Or an array of blog posts. Or if a modal is open or not and which tab within it is active.

React components with state render UI based on that state. When the state of components changes, so does the component UI.

That makes understanding when and how to change the state of your component important. At the end of this tutorial, you should know how setState works, and be able to avoid common pitfalls that many of us hit when when learning React.

### Forms

HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.

This form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form. If you want this behavior in React, it just works. But in most cases, it’s convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form. The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called “controlled components”.


## Why React Testing Library
Basically, React Testing Library (RTL) is made of simple and complete React DOM testing utilities that encourage good testing practices, especially one:

The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you. - Kent C. Dodds

In fact, developers tend to test what we call implementation details. Let’s take a simple example to explain it. We want to create a counter that we can both increment and decrement. Here is the implementation (with a class component) with two tests: the first one is written with Enzyme and the other one with React Testing Library.
