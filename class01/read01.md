- Write your HTML and CSS more efficiently.
```

## THE COMMAND LINE!
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

* line 1 : typically command is always the first thing to type.
* line 2-5 : are output from running the command.
* line 6 : presents us with a prompt again.
***
## OPENING TERMINAL
* If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities.
* If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities.
* If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client
***
## THE SHELL, BASH
Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell and bash which stands for Bourne again shell.

## FILES & EXTENSION
Everything is actually a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file, your monitor is a file, etc.
but extension denotes what type of file it is. 
examples:
file.exe - an executable file, or program.
file.txt - a plain text file.
file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
***
## NOTES
* Linux is case sensitive
* ls -a List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
* Be a little careful with spaces so anything inside quotes is considered a single item.
* Backslash ( \ ) is an escape charachter.
