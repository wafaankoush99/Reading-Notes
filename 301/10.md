# Call Stack

## what is javaScript call stack

The call stack is a mechanism that helps the JavaScript interpreter to keep track of the functions that a script calls. Every time a script or function calls a function, it's added to the top of the call stack. Every time the function exits, the interpreter removes it from the call stack.

Let us take a look at a code sample to demonstrate LIFO by printing a stack trace error to the console.

```
function firstFunction(){
  throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');
}

function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
}

function thirdFunction(){
  secondFunction();
}

thirdFunction();
```

When the code is run, we get an error. A stack is printed showing how the functions are stack on top each other. Take a look at the diagram.

In summary
The key takeaways from the call stack are:
1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
2. Code execution is synchronous.
3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
4. It works as a LIFO â€” Last In, First Out data structure.
