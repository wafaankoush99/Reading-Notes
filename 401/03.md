# Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 3 real world use cases where you'd want to change the request with custom middleware

- Application level middleware
- Built in middleware
- Error handling middleware

2. True or false: The route handler is middleware?

True 

3. In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?

- res.send()
- res.redirect()
- res.render()
- res.sendFile()
- res.download()

4. At what point in the request lifecycle can you "inject" middleware?

when sending a request or a request parameter by the client side will inject the middleware

5. What can cause express to error with "Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response"

may be there is a callback function accidentally called twice per request, or any error that happens after body is sent

## ESC Classes

ES6 classes are templates for creating JavaScript objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. However, JavaScript classes are nothing but just syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritance and constructor functions.

## Using Express Routing

It is a mini express application without all the bells and whistles of an express application, just the routing stuff.

Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.

app.get() ==> to handle GET requests
app.post() ==> to handle POST requests


app.all() ==> to handle all HTTP methods
used to load middleware functions at a path for all HTTP request methods.
so handler is executed for requests to the route whether using GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or any other HTTP request method supported

app.use() ==> to specify middleware as the callback function

These routing methods specify a callback function ((handler func.)) and can have more than one callback function as arguments. **to hand off control to the next callback.**

it is important to provide next as an argument to the callback function 

**Route paths**

Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made. Route paths can be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions.

The characters ?, +, *, and () are subsets of their regular expression counterparts. The hyphen (-) and the dot (.) are interpreted literally by string-based paths.

If you need to use the dollar character ($) in a path string, enclose it escaped within ([ and ]). For example, the path string for requests at “/data/$book”, would be “/data/([\$])book”.

```
// get an instance of router
var router = express.Router();
// apply the routes to our application
app.use('/', router);
```
we can set a default root for the routes we just defined by this way.

 If we had changed app.use('/app', router), then our routes would be http://localhost:8080/app and http://localhost:8080/app/about.

 **benefit of it**

 This is very powerful because we can create multiple express.Router()s and then apply them to our application. We could have a Router for our basic routes, authenticated routes, and even API routes.
we are allowed to make our applications more modular and flexible than ever before by creating multiple instances of the Router and applying them accordingly
 
```
// route middleware that will happen on every request
router.use(function(req, res, next) {

    // log each request to the console
    console.log(req.method, req.url);

    // continue doing what we were doing and go to the route
    next(); 
});
```

```
// route middleware to validate :name
router.param('name', function(req, res, next, name) {
    // do validation on name here
    // blah blah validation
    // log something so we know its working
    console.log('doing name validations on ' + name);

    // once validation is done save the new item in the req
    req.name = name;
    // go to the next thing
    next(); 
});
```
