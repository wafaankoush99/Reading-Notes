# Review, Research, and Discussion

## Array.map()

The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

arr.map has a callback function that takes 2 param. first one for the current element being proceed in the array, and second one for its index
arr.map is always return you a new array of the same length as the original array.

```js
const array1 = [1, 4, 9, 16];

// pass a function to map
const map1 = array1.map(x => x * 2);

console.log(map1);
// expected output: Array [2, 8, 18, 32]
```

## Array.reduce() 

The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.

The array.reduce() method iterate over an array and runs a callback for each element, the call back receives the accumulator, the value, and the index of the array element

The original array will never be harmed

The accumulator is a placeholder for what you want to return when the callback iteration is done running

```js
const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const reducer = (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue;

// 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
console.log(array1.reduce(reducer));
// expected output: 10

// 5 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
console.log(array1.reduce(reducer, 5));
// expected output: 15
```

## superagent()

SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. works with Node. js.

```js
 request
   .post('/api/pet')
   .send({ name: 'Manny', species: 'cat' })
   .set('X-API-Key', 'foobar')
   .set('Accept', 'application/json')
   .then(res => {
      alert('yay got ' + JSON.stringify(res.body));
   });
```
A request can be initiated by invoking the appropriate method on the request object, then calling .then() (or .end() or await) to send the request. For example a simple GET request:

.then :
```
 request
   .get('/search')
   .then(res => {
      // res.body, res.headers, res.status
   })
   .catch(err => {
      // err.message, err.response
   });
```
await :


```
// pattern: https?+unix://SOCKET_PATH/REQUEST_PATH
//          Use `%2F` as `/` in SOCKET_PATH
try {
  const res = await request
    .get('http+unix://%2Fabsolute%2Fpath%2Fto%2Funix.sock/search');
  // res.body, res.headers, res.status
} catch(err) {
  // err.message, err.response
}
```

## Promise

The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.

A Promise is in one of these states:

pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

Chained Promises
The methods promise.then(), promise.catch(), and promise.finally() are used to associate further action with a promise that becomes settled.

The .then() method takes up to two arguments; the first argument is a callback function for the resolved case of the promise, and the second argument is a callback function for the rejected case. Each .then() returns a newly generated promise object, which can optionally be used for chaining;


Processing continues to the next link of the chain even when a .then() lacks a callback function that returns a Promise object. Therefore, a chain can safely omit every rejection callback function until the final .catch().

## Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?

Simply taking a callback doesn't make a function asynchronous. There are many examples of functions that take a function argument but are not asynchronous. ... It iterates over each item and calls the function once per item.
