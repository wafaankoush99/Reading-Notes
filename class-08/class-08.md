-  It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
-  Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
-  Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
-  Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
-  You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
-  You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
