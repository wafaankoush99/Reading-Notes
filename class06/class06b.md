## WHAT IS CSS ?

**C**ascading **S**tyle **Sheet**
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

## Why use External Style Sheets?

When building a website there are several advantages to placing your CSS rules in a separate style sheet. Although they may appear within an HTML page.



***

# Some Examples:



- Text colour

```
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> text </p>

```
- Font style & size.

```
  div.example {
    font-size: 80px;
  }
```


- Placment of content.

```

div.static {
  position: static;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}

```

- Size, type & weight of borders.

```
p.outset {border-style: outset;}

```

### NOTES 


* Rules are made up of selectors and declarations.

* Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.

* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties and the values
of those properties.
