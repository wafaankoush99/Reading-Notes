# Javascript Templating

Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. 

Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

Configure mustache-express in your server.js/app.js/index.js file:

Ruby is a programming language whereas Rails is a gem, or a Ruby library. Specifically, Rails is a web framework that helps make web applications by providing classes for saving to the database, handling URLs and displaying HTML (along with a webserver, maintenance tasks, a debugging console and much more).

# FLEX

![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/flex-direction.svg)

row (default): left to right in ltr; right to left in rtl
row-reverse: right to left in ltr; left to right in rtl
column: same as row but top to bottom
column-reverse: same as row-reverse but bottom to top

```css
.container {
  flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
}
```

![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/flex-wrap.svg)

```css
.container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
}
```

nowrap (default): all flex items will be on one line
wrap: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.
wrap-reverse: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top.

![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/justify-content.svg)

.container {
  justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | start | end | left | right ... + safe | unsafe;
}

flex-start (default): items are packed toward the start of the flex-direction.
flex-end: items are packed toward the end of the flex-direction.
start: items are packed toward the start of the writing-mode direction.
end: items are packed toward the end of the writing-mode direction.
left: items are packed toward left edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like start.
right: items are packed toward right edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like end.
center: items are centered along the line
space-between: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line
space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.
space-evenly: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.
