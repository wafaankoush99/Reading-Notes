What is a graph ?

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

What is these trminology means ?

vetrex , edge, neighbor , degree

- Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

Undirected Graphs
An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

Directed Graphs (Digraph)
A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

Complete Graphs
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

Connected
A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
