## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Can a parent component access the state of a child component? 

To be able to access and update state from the child component, we can add a method that handles updating the state to the parent component and pass the method as a prop to the child component instead of the state itself.


2. What can be passed along in a prop variable?

    objects, functions

2. How can a child component “know” the state of another component?

by passing its data to the parent (setState) then return it back to the another component 

## Term

- component props

Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.


- component state

setState() schedules an update to a component's state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.


- application state

Application State (also known as Program State) represents the totality of everything necessary to keep your application running. When we refer to application state we are normally referring to the state of the program as it exists in the contents of its memory.



```
The difference between this and application state is that application state is narrowed down through cursor paths - that is, sub components may not have access to the entire application state - while shared state is always accessible.
```

## The Component Lifecycle

Each colored horizontal rectangle represents a lifecycle method (except for “React updates DOM and refs”). The columns represent different stages in the components life.

A component can only be in one stage at a time. It starts with mounting and moves onto updating. It stays updating perpetually until it gets removed from the virtual DOM. Then it goes into the unmounting phase and gets removed from the DOM.

The lifecycle methods allow us to run code at specific points in the component’s life or in response to changes in the component’s life.

## Mounting

Since class-based components are classes, hence the name, the first method that runs is the constructor method. Typically, the constructor is where you would initialize component state.

Next, the component runs the getDerivedStateFromProps.

## Updating

This phase is triggered every time state or props change. Like in mounting, getDerivedStateFromProps is called (but no constructor this time!).

## Unmounting

Our component lived a good life, but all good things must come to an end. The unmounting phase is that last stage of the component lifecycle. When you remove a component from the DOM, React runs componentWillUnmount right before it gets removed. You should use this method to clean up any open connections such as WebSockets or intervals.

## What even is ‘children’?
The React docs say that you can use props.children on components that represent ‘generic boxes’ and that ‘don’t know their children ahead of time’. For me, that didn’t really clear things up. I’m sure for some, that definition makes perfect sense but it didn’t for me.

## Composition vs Inheritance

Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a component’s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way. Remember that components may accept arbitrary props, including primitive values, React elements, or functions.

If you want to reuse non-UI functionality between components, we suggest extracting it into a separate JavaScript module. The components may import it and use that function, object, or a class, without extending it.
