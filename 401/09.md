# OAuth 2 Simplified

### The Third-Party Application: "Client"
The client is the application that is attempting to get access to the user's account. It needs to get permission from the user before it can do so.

### The API: "Resource Server"
The resource server is the API server used to access the user's information.

### The Authorization Server
This is the server that presents the interface where the user approves or denies the request. In smaller implementations, this may be the same server as the API server, but larger scale deployments will often build this as a separate component.

### The User: "Resource Owner"
The resource owner is the person who is giving access to some portion of their account.

### Client ID and Secret
After registering your app, you will receive a client ID and optionally a client secret. The client ID is considered public information, and is used to build login URLs, or included in Javascript source code on a page. The client secret must be kept confidential. If a deployed app cannot keep the secret confidential, such as single-page Javascript apps or native apps, then the secret is not used, and ideally the service shouldn't issue a secret to these types of apps in the first place.

### OAuth
 is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.[1][2] This mechanism is used by companies such as Amazon,[3] Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter to permit the users to share information about their accounts with third party applications or websites.


### OAuth 2 provides several "grant types" for different use cases. The grant types defined are:

- Authorization Code for apps running on a web server, browser-based and mobile apps
- Password for logging in with a username and password (only for first-party apps)
- Client credentials for application access without a user present
- Implicit was previously recommended for clients without a secret, but has been superseded by using the Authorization Code grant with PKCE.

### OAuth and XACML
XACML is a policy-based, attribute-based access control authorization framework. It provides:

- An access control architecture.
- A policy language with which to express a wide range of access control policies including policies that can use consents handled / defined via OAuth.
- A request / response scheme to send and receive authorization requests.


XACML and OAuth can be combined together to deliver a more comprehensive approach to authorization. OAuth does not provide a policy language with which to define access control policies. XACML can be used for its policy language.
