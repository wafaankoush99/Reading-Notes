# Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren't working).


2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC

A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client. In a data center, the physical computer that a server program runs on is also frequently referred to as a server.

3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

Deploying your application means putting it on a Web server so that it can be used either through the Internet or an intranet.


# Terms 

A **server** is a computer that serves information to other computers. These computers, called clients, can connect to a server through either a local area network or a wide area network, such as the internet. A server is a vital piece of your IT infrastructure.

**Publish/subscribe** messaging, or pub/sub messaging, is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. In a pub/sub model, any message published to a topic is immediately received by all of the subscribers to the topic.

**WRRC** The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren't working).

## Amazon EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

### Reliable, scalable, infrastructure on demand

- Increase or decrease capacity within minutes, not hours or days
- SLA commitment of 99.99% availability for each Amazon EC2 region. Each region consists of at least 3 availability zones
- The AWS Region/AZ model has been recognized by Gartner as the recommended approach for running enterprise applications that require high availability

### Secure compute for your applications

- With the AWS Nitro System virtualization resources are offloaded to dedicated hardware and software minimizing the attack surface
- Lockdown security model prohibits administrative access eliminating possibility of human error and tampering
- AWS supports 89 security standards and compliance certifications including PCI-DSS, HIPAA/HITECH, FedRAMP, GDPR, FIPS 140-2, and NIST 800-171, which is meaningfully more than any other cloud provider
