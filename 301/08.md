## What is SQL?

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

### Relational databases

A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

**A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for**

### SQL Statement:

Select query for a specific columns :

```
SELECT column, another_column, â€¦
FROM mytable;
```

Select query for all columns :

```
SELECT * 
FROM mytable;
```
