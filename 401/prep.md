**Common mistakes**
1. try to start writing code as soon as possible.
2. try to over solve the solution on the first iteration.

**These are simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.**

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

1. **Understand** : Know exactly what is being asked (write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it).

2. **Plan** : Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

3. **Divide** : break the problem into sub-problems, Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.

4. **Stuck?** : Debug / Reassess / Research

5. **Practice** :Something that allows you to solve many micro-problems (ideally, something you enjoy).

# 5 Whys Technique

You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving.


**How to Use the 5 Whys ?!**

The 5 Whys strategy is a simple, effective tool for uncovering the root of a problem. You can use it in troubleshooting, problem-solving, and quality-improvement initiatives.

Start with a problem and ask why it is occurring. Make sure that your answer is grounded in fact, and then ask the question again. Continue the process until you reach the root cause of the problem, and you can identify a counter-measure that will prevent it from recurring.

"cultivate extreme focus with whatever you do."

“Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.”

“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.”
