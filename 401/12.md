## Review, Research, and Discussion


- What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?


Packets are intended to transfer data reliably and efficiently. Instead of transferring a large file as a single block of data, sending smaller packets helps ensure each section is transmitted successfully.


- UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?

UDP is a connectionless protocol. It is known as a datagram protocol because it is analogous to sending a letter where you don't acknowledge receipt. 


- Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?

A server socket listens on a single port. ... Multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs, and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to.


- Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?

A server socket listens on a single port. ... Multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs, and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to.


- Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?

Yes

## Term

The **observer pattern** is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.


An event **listener** is a procedure or function in a computer program that waits for an event to occur.

**Event Handler**
A software routine that provides the processing for various events such as mouse movement, a mouse click, a keystroke or a spoken word. See event, event driven and event management system. Advertisement.

 **event-driven programming** is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or threads.

 **event loop** is a programming construct or design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. ... The event loop is also sometimes referred to as the message dispatcher, message loop, message pump, or run loop.

 **event queue** is a repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system. Event queues are often used in the context of an enterprise messaging system.

 A **call stack** is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions

 **emit** When we call a function the function may return a value. When we call a function and the function is supposed to send those results to another function we will not user return anymore. Instead we use emit. We expect the function to emit the results to another function by our call.
A function can return results and emit events.

**raise** is a simple statement with the following syntax: raise [ expression1 [, expression2 ]] Only an exception handler (or a function that a handler calls, directly or indirectly) can use raise without any expressions. A plain raise statement reraises the same exception object that the handler received.

**Subscription** is a connection between Subscriber and Publisher. Basically, Publisher will create a subscription for every Subscriber which will try to subscribe to it, and this subscription will handle requests from the subscriber. Publisher act as the storage of data and subscription will obtain data from it.

A **database** is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. ... The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.

## WebSocket

WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. 

Protocol handshake:

To establish a WebSocket connection, the client sends a WebSocket handshake request, for which the server returns a WebSocket handshake response, as shown in the example below.

Client request (just like in HTTP, each line ends with \r\n and there must be an extra blank line at the end

```
GET /chat HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: x3JJHMbDL1EzLkh9GBhXDw==
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Origin: http://example.com
```

```
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: HSmrc0sMlYUkAGmm5OPpG2HaGWk=
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat
```

## Difference Between WebSocket and Socket.io

WebSocket is the communication Protocol that provides bidirectional communication between the Client and the Server over a TCP connection; WebSocket remains open all the time, so they allow real-time data transfer. When clients trigger the request to the server, it does not close the connection on receiving the response; it rather persists and waits for the Client or server to terminate the request.


Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time and full-duplex communication between the Client and the Web servers. It uses the WebSocket protocol to provide the interface. Generally, it is divided into two parts; both WebSocket vs Socket.io are event-driven libraries.

### Key features of WebSocket 

- WebSocket helps in real-time communication between the Client and the webserver.
- This protocol helps in transforming to cross-platform in a real-time world between the server and the client.
- This also enables the business worldwide for a real-time web application to enhance and increase the feasibility.
- The major advantage it stands over an HTTP connection that it provides full-duplex communication.

### Key features of Socket.IO

- It helps in broadcasting to multiple sockets at a time and handles the connection transparently.
- It works on all platform, server or device, ensuring equality, reliability, and speed.
- It automatically upgrades the requirement to WebSocket if needed.
- It is a custom real-time transport protocol implementation on top of other protocols.
- It requires both libraries to be used Client side as well as a server-side library.
- IO works on work-based events. there are some reserved events that can be accessed using the Socket on the server side like Connect, message, Disconnect, Ping and Reconnect.
- There are some Client based reserved events like Connect, connect- error, connect-timeout and Reconnect etc.
