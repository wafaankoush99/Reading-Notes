# HTTP & REST

* That first part tells the browser what protocol to use.
capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.


* The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.

* Kind of. A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs--those things that you type into the browser...

* Those URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.

## SuperAgent
SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with Node.js!

```
request
   .post('/api/pet')
   .send({ name: 'Manny', species: 'cat' })
   .set('X-API-Key', 'foobar')
   .set('Accept', 'application/json')
   .then(res => {
      alert('yay got ' + JSON.stringify(res.body));
   });
```
