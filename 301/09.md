# functional programming

## What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

## What makes a function pure?

**It returns the same result if given the same arguments because it uses a global object that was not passed as a parameter to the function.**

ex: 
```
let PI = 3.14;

const calculateArea = (radius) => radius * radius * PI;

calculateArea(10); // returns 314.0
```

**If our function reads external files, it’s not a pure function — the file’s contents can change.**

```
const charactersCounter = (text) => `Character count: ${text.length}`;

function analyzeFile(filename) {
  let fileContent = open(filename);
  return charactersCounter(fileContent);
}
```
**It does not cause any observable side effects**

**When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.**

**This pure function will always have the same output, given the same input.**

**pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency**

## Map

## The map method transforms a collection by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values.

We're going to refactor some pieces of code based off real examples that I've come across. Sometimes I'll need to perform this kind of refactoring on my own code before submitting a PR. Other times I'll do a small refactor of existing code at the start of a story or bug to make my changes easier to implement.

```
// Unrefactored code

const URLstore = [];

function makeShort(URL) {
  const rndName = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2);
  URLstore.push({[rndName]: URL});
  return rndName;
}

function getLong(shortURL) {
  for (let i = 0; i < URLstore.length; i++) {
    if (URLstore[i].hasOwnProperty(shortURL) !== false) {
      return URLstore[i][shortURL];
    }
  }
}
```


Problem: what happens if getLong is called with a short URL that isn't in the store? Nothing is explicitly returned so undefined will be returned. Since we're not sure how we're going to handle that, let's be explicit and throw an error so that problems can be spotted during development.

Performance-wise, be careful if you're iterating through a flat array very often, especially if it's a core piece of your program. The refactor here is to change the data-structure of URLstore.

Currently, each URL object is stored in an array. We'll visualize this as a row of buckets. When we want to convert short to long, on average we need to check half of those buckets before we find the correct short URL. What if we have thousands of buckets, and we perform this hundreds of times a second?

The answer is to use some form of hash function, which Maps and Sets use under the surface. A hash function is used to map a given key to a location in the hash table.

```
// Refactored code

const URLstore = new Map(); // Change this to a Map

function makeShort(URL) {
  const rndName = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2);
  // Place the short URL into the Map as the key with the long URL as the value
  URLstore.set(rndName, URL);
  return rndName;
}

function getLong(shortURL) {
  // Leave the function early to avoid an unnecessary else statement
  if (URLstore.has(shortURL) === false) {
    throw 'Not in URLstore!';
  }
  return URLstore.get(shortURL); // Get the long URL out of the Map
}
```
