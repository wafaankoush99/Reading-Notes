# Ethics
`The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of`
This article depicts an interesting story. As a developer is it your role to criticise what you're asked to code or are you just supposed to do your work and code what you're asked to. I experienced this sort of situation in a previous job where I didn't like and wasn't comfortable doing what I was asked to. Now I'm on the job market I think that doing a deep reserch on the company, of their products, clients etc is crucial to make sure I'm feeling comfortable working for them.

`The ethical dilemmas of self-driving cars`
I agree with this article on the point that society is not ready to have self driving cars as a new normal. The ethical dilemmas this it points out is very interesting. I my-selft cannot answer the question on when a child jumps suddenly into the car's path from the curb. There's no time to brake. What then? Veer left into oncoming traffic, possibly causing an accident that would injure the driver and passengers? Veer right onto the sidewalk, possibly injuring pedestrians? Continue straight, possibly colliding with the child? Today when there are vistims we need culprits. In the situation of accidents with self-driving cars who would be the culprit?
