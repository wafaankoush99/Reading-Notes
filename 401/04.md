# Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
 
    1. Better program design and higher code quality

    2. Detailed project documentation

    3. TDD reduces the time required for project development


2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

**beforeEach()**  removes the explicit calls from the tests themselves

**afterEach()** invites inexperienced users to share state between tests.

3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development?

when writing code that apparently takes an extended time

4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

Classes contain constructor and its methods 

Constructors need a prototype outside the function to inherit its methods and properties

5. Why REST? 

REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia.

# SQL vs NoSQL Database

| SQL      | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Data uses schemas     | Schemas less |
| Relations | No (or very few) relations|
| Data is distributed across multiple tables | Data is typically merged/ nested in a few collections|
| Horizontal scaling is difficult/ Impossible vertical scaling | both are possible|
| Limitations for lots of (thousands) read & write queries per second | Great performance for mass (simple read and write requests)|

For complex queries: SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries

## MongoDB

Mongodb is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema. It has been developed by the founders of DoubleClick, written in C++ and is currently being used by some big companies like The New York Times, Craigslist, MTV Networks. The following are some of MongoDB benefits and strengths:

- Speed
- Scalability
- Manageable
- Dynamic Schema
