## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server


2. List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each

Amazon RDS : 

Managed Relational Database Service for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle BYOL, or SQL Server and can’t be integrated with lambda function in aws.

Amazon DynamoDB :

Fast and flexible NoSQL database with seamless scalability and can be integrated with lambda function in aws.

3. What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

Standard queues guarantee that a message is delivered at least once and duplicates can be introduced into the queue. FIFO queues ensure a message is delivered exactly once and remains available until a consumer processes and deletes it; duplicates are not introduced into the queue.


4. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?


The client (usually a browser) opens a connection to the server and sends a request. The server processes the request, generates a response, and closes the connection if it finds a Connection: Close header. ... Headers may provide various information about the request or the client body data.


## TERMS :

**Serverless** is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider.

A **triggering** term is a word or phrase that, when used in advertising literature, requires the presentation of the terms of a credit agreement. Triggering terms are intended to help consumers compare credit and lease offers on a fair and equal basis.

**DynamoDB** is a fully managed AWS service, **MongoDB** can be self installed or fully managed with MongoDB Atlas. ... DynamoDB uses tables, items and attributes, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents. DynamoDB supports limited data types and smaller item sizes; MongoDB supports more data types and has fewer size restrictions.


**Dynamoose** is a DynamoDB API structured like **Mongoose**, lets us provide a schema and perform CRUD operations against a DynamoDB table, installed via node and configured based on role.

## AWS — Difference between SQS and SNS

SQS and SNS are important components for scalable, large scale, distributed, cloud-based applications:
SNS is a distributed publish-subscribe service.
SQS is distributed queuing service.

SNS (Simple Notification Service)

Amazon SNS is a fast, flexible, fully managed push notification service that lets you send individual messages or to bulk messages to large numbers of recipients. Amazon SNS makes it simple and cost effective to send push notifications to mobile device users, email recipients or even send messages to other distributed services.

SQS (Simple Queue Service)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1700/1*7eL3udb6Cto4I9Ly1sN8oA.jpeg)


SQS is distributed queuing system. Messages are not pushed to receivers. Receivers have to poll SQS to receive messages. Messages can’t be received by multiple receivers at the same time. Any one receiver can receive a message, process and delete it. Other receivers do not receive the same message later.
Polling inherently introduces some latency in message delivery in SQS unlike SNS where messages are immediately pushed to subscribers.

```
You don’t have to couple SNS and SQS always. You can have SNS send messages to email, sms or http end point apart from SQS. There are advantages to coupling SNS with SQS. You may not want an external service to make connections to your hosts (firewall may block all incoming connections to your host from outside). Your end point may just die because of heavy volume of messages. Email and SMS maybe not your choice of processing messages quickly. By coupling SNS with SQS, you can receive messages at your pace. It allows clients to be offline, tolerant to network and host failures. You also achieve guaranteed delivery. If you configure SNS to send messages to an http end point or email or SMS, several failures to send message may result in message being dropped.
```
