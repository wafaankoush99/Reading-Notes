# Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?

Whereas HTTP relies on a client request to receive a response from the server for every exchange, WebSockets allow for full-duplex bidirectional communication. This enables the server to send real-time updates asynchronously, without requiring the client to submit a request each time.


2. Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?

No, instead of sending requests and responses ,, socket.io use a protocol (TCP) to conduct servers together.

3. What happens when a client emits an event?


emit() to send a message to all the connected clients. This code will notify when a user connects to the server. io. on("connection", function(socket) { io.


4. What happens when a server emits an event?

An event emitter is a pattern that listens to a named event, fires a callback, then emits that event with a value. Sometimes this is referred to as a “pub/sub” model, or listener.Mar 25, 2019

5. What happens if a client “misses” an event?

6. How can we mitigate this?

Unhandled messages are just ignored. It's just like when an event occurs and there are no event listeners for that event. The socket receives the msg and doesn't find a handler for it so nothing happens with it.

You could avoid missing messages by always having the handlers installed and then deciding in the handlers (based on other state) whether to do anything with the message or not.

## Term

A **socket** is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to. ... Every TCP connection can be uniquely identified by its two endpoints.

**WebSocket** is a protocol that allows for a persistent TCP connection between server and client so they can exchange data at any time.

**Socket.IO** is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. Both components have a nearly identical API.

A **client** is a computer or a program that, as part of its operation, relies on sending a request to another program or a computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server 

term **server** refers to a computer program or process (running program). Through metonymy, it refers to a device used for (or a device dedicated to) running one or several server programs. On a network, such a device is called a host.

The **OSI Model** (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. The OSI model characterizes computing functions into a universal set of rules and requirements in order to support interoperability between different products and software.

**TCP Model**
It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains four layers, unlike seven layers in the OSI model.

**The Transmission Control Protocol** (TCP) is a transport protocol that is used on top of IP to ensure reliable transmission of packets. TCP includes mechanisms to solve many of the problems that arise from packet-based messaging, such as lost packets, out of order packets, duplicate packets, and corrupted packets.

**UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) is a communications protocol that is primarily used for establishing low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet. It speeds up transmissions by enabling the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the receiving party.

A **packet** is the unit of data that is routed between an origin and a destination on the Internet or any other packet-switched network. ... Each packet sent includes information such as the source and destination, the protocols or identifications.

## SOCKET

Sockets have traditionally been the solution around which most real-time chat systems are architected, providing a bi-directional communication channel between a client and a server.

This means that the server can push messages to clients. Whenever you write a chat message, the idea is that the server will get it and push it to all other connected clients.

## Rooms

A room is an arbitrary channel that sockets can join and leave. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients:

### Default room

Each Socket in Socket.IO is identified by a random, unguessable, unique identifier Socket#id. For your convenience, each socket automatically joins a room identified by its own id.

Sample use cases:

- broadcast data to each device / tab of a given user
- send notifications about a given entity


### Disconnection

Upon disconnection, sockets leave all the channels they were part of automatically, and no special teardown is needed on your part.

You can fetch the rooms the Socket was in by listening to the disconnecting event

### multiple Socket.IO servers
