### HTML CODE

Elements are usually made up of two
tags: an opening tag and a closing tag and each HTML element tells the browser
something about the information that sits between them.

### ATTRIBUTES

Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign.

### BODY, HEAD & TITLE

`<body>` Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.

`<head>` Contains information about the page.

`<title>` Shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL.

**NOTES**

1. `<div>` elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
2. **Float property** moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. 
3. Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
5. Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
6. CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
7. You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

## HTML5

- Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a <form> element.
- Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
- Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.
- HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.
